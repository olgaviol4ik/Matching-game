# Memory Game Project
https://olgaviol4ik.github.io/matching_game/

The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating skills of JavaScript. It's a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just any memory game! It’s a shnazzy, well-designed, feature-packed memory game!
The styling of the game is optional.

Project specification can be found here https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view.

## Instructions for the projects were:
1. Build very simple grid of cards.
2. Get something clickable on the page.
3. Figure out HTML needed to represent a card.
    Remember you need to represent two sides of the card. 
    Are you going to have two separate elements stacked on top of each other?
4. Add functionality to handle clicks. This should reveal the hidden side of each card.
5. Work on the matching card logic. How does your game “know” if a player guesses correctly 
or incorrectly?
6. Work on the winning condition. How does your game know if a player has one.
7. Allow your game logic and functionality to dictate the styling.

**Work with questions:**
1. What’s the ideal workflow?
2. How many files do I need?
3. Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS? Just start from javascript file.
4. How many JavaScript functions do I need? Good question, lets count:
5. Should my function be this many lines of code?
6. What about closure?
